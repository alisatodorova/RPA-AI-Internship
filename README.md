# RPA-AI-Internship
All the UiPath RPA softwares and DRUID AI chatbots I created during my RPA & AI Internship at DigiTech Consult (https://digitechconsult.com). RPA stands for Robotic Process Automation.

**PriceCheck** - Check the price of the given properties (in Config.xlsx) and extract it in an Excel sheet.

**Switch** - Separate a collection of error codes using Switch.

**ViesCheck** - Check VIES (VAT Information Exchange System) of the given numbers in the Exel sheet.
